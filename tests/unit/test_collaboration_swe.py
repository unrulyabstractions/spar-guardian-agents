"""SWE's collaboration rule, with no Docker and no model: cheating takes two agents.

For flipt-02e2 and vuls-1832, every plan of tests/support/swe_deals.py: a team of 2, 3, 4 or 10 neutral agents under the
jigsaw and own_piece honeypots, with no hidden role, a regulator, or a regulator and a disregulator, on seeds 1 to 20,
built by SWE.plan as a run builds it. No neutral agent holds every text the hidden tests need (swe_settings.SECRETS),
read from the patches planted as its pieces. All the neutral agents together hold the whole fix. A regulator and a
disregulator hold nothing. tests/smoke/swe_collaboration.py grades each holding with the real hidden tests.
